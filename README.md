# Welcome to the AREA project !


## What is the AREA project ?

_AREA_
The AREA project consists in setting up a web and mobile application enabling a user to create actions - reactions
These actions - reactions called "AREA" - can be created from a graphical interface.

_Services choice_
We need to choose the different services we're going to implement in our project. We've decided to use Discord, Trello, Github, Asana, Google and Jira.

_What's an AREA_
The purpose of an AREA is quite simple, for example, we create an area:
Trello - Card created -> Discord - Received a private message, Jira - Card created
This area will detect when a user creates a card on Trello, and will then send a private message on discord to that same user and create a card on the Jira board.
